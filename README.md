Home assignments and final project of Introduction to Data Science course at Skoltech.

To determine the type of rocks and their characteristics, geophysical well surveys (GIS) are carried out. A probe is lowered into the well, which measures physical parameters.
There is a relationship between certain types of rocks and the physical characteristics being measured: clays - intense gamma radiation, limestone or salts - high current conductivity, etc.
Traditionally, it is the geologist who interprets such data. And in the case of a large amount of data, it takes a long time. We decided to make a model for classifying rock types. This can be a useful tool for the geologist.
